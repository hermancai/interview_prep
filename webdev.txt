--What is the difference between encrypting and hashing?
  Encrypted data can later be decrypted.
  Hashing cannot be undone. The hashing process, given an input, should always give the same output, 
    and outputs should never be the same for two different inputs. 

--What is progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?
  Progressive enhancement: Starting development with a baseline of old browsers. 
    Apply advanced features when a browser can support it.
  Graceful degradation: Start with the newest browsers.
    For old browsers that cannot support newer features, maintain basic functionality.
