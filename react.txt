--What is JSX?
  Javascript and XML. Syntatic sugar for React. When compiled, turns into React.createElement().

--Why is 'className' used instead of 'class' for styling elements?
  'Class' is a reserved keyword in Javascript.

--Describe dataflow in React.
  Flow is unidirectional. All components have a parent-child relationship.
  Data (props) move down from parent to child.

--How to delay an API call until a component has mounted?
  In traditional class components, componentDidMount().
  In modern functional components, useEffect(). Use empty array as dependency to run once.

--Should you use ternary or && operator to render elements?
  Use ternary. Falsy values can cause bugs with the && operator. 
  Ex: array[0] holds a value so something should render, but if the value is 0, then no render.

--What is a hook?
  Introduced in React v16.8 for use with functional components.
  Hooks are functions that "hook" into React state and lifecycle features. 
  Only call hooks at the top level (i.e. not inside loops, conditions, nested functions.)
  Only call hooks from inside React functional components and custom hooks.
  Custom Hooks: normal Javascript functions that handle stateful logic and can be 
    reused in multiple components. Custom hooks can contain built-in hooks (e.g. useState, 
    useEffect). Components that share a custom hook have independent states. Reusing stateful logic 
    was traditionally handled with higher-order components and render props.
  Conventionally, hook names start with "use", including custom hooks.
