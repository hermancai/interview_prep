'''
Use a single array to implement three stacks.

Solutions:

##### 1
Split the list into three equal parts, and assign a stack to each.
The stacks will have fixed space and cannot grow.

##### 2
Split the list into three equal parts, and assign a stack to each.
The stacks can grow by shifting elements in other stacks.
The list can be circular such that one stack wraps from the end 
  of the list back to the front.
